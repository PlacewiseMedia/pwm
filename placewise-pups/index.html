  <p>Lloyd has risen through the ranks to top dog in the office.  On duty full time, Lloyd’s your guy when you need an assist in the kitchen or break room. Between naps, he’s also our hall monitor.  When protocol is broken or shenanigans get out of hand, Lloyd is there to keep us in line.</p>

  <h3>Taco</h3>

  <p>Taco is a bundle of energy and really loves to play. In fact, he is obsessed with tennis balls, and he is a convicted toy thief. He enjoys coming to work with Nate via bicycle (he rides quite happily in Nate's backpack).</p>
