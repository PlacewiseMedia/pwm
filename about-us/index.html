  <p>Everyone knows that e-commerce has transformed the retail landscape in revolutionary ways. Digital access to information has altered shopping behavior fundamentally. Mobile and social platforms are reinventing shopping even further. In the midst of this sea change, traditional physical retail faces challenges that seem truly daunting.</p>

  <p>Yet digital, social and mobile tactics–applied with the same best-in-class practices of the massive e-tailers–can drive more than just Internet “eyeballs.” It can drive actual foot traffic, too.</p>
