  <p>Everyone knows that e-commerce has transformed the retail landscape in revolutionary ways. Digital access to information has altered shopping behavior fundamentally. Mobile and social platforms are reinventing shopping even further. In the midst of this sea change, traditional physical retail faces challenges that seem truly daunting.</p>

  <p>Yet digital, social and mobile tactics–applied with the same best-in-class practices of the massive e-tailers–can drive more than just Internet “eyeballs.” It can drive actual foot traffic, too.</p>

  <p>We know, because we make it happen. At PlaceWise Media, we are shopper-centric digital media experts. Our services are used by nearly 700 malls and shopping centers in the U.S. plus a growing number of grocery retailers, making us both the largest AND the fastest-growing company in our industry. </p>
